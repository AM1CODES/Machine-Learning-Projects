# Machine Learning @ DSC VIT
---
A open-source repository hosting some fun projects that you can work on to improve your ML/DL skills. We will continue to add more projects in the future for all skill levels, ranging from beginner to advanced as our initiative of promoting learning and open source contribution among all.

### PROJECTS ON SHOWCASE:

> This project deals with the age old problem in optical character recognition— Dealing w/ noise in the image data that can lead up to misrepresentation and inaccuracies during inference. Here, we implement an AutoEncoder model using TensorFlow and Keras that eliminates noise/distortions within the image data for better OCR operation.

### PROJECT CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES:
---
In order to contribute to an existing project, the following are the guidelines you must follow:
* __Modeling and Optimization__: For the given problem statement/dataset in a project, if your proposed solution *(can be a different model architecture, or optimized set of hyperparameters for the existing model)* performs better than the existing one, then your submission will be accepted.
> In this case, kindly submit a separate jupyter notebook, and while raising a PR, include the screenshot of your results.
> Naming scheme for new jupyter notebook: <architecture_name>.ipynb
* __Code Optimization__: You can improve the space-time complexity of the existing code in a given project. For example- Using vectorization and broadcasting methods to eliminate loops, etc.
> For this, modify the code in the existing jupyter notebook.
* __Resolving Existing Issues__: You can address the existing issues within the repository.
* __Contributing your Personal Projects__: If you have a fun personal project that you would love to showcase here, raise an issue regarding the same and we will get back to you soon.
